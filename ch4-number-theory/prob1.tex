\textbf{Solution: }
$$
\begin{aligned}
n^3 + 100 &= n^3 + 10^3 - 900 \\
&= (n + 10)(n^2 - 10 \cdot n + 10^2) - 900 \\
&= (n + 10)(n^2 - 10n + 100) - 900 \\
\end{aligned}
$$
Here $n + 10$ is a factor of $n^3 + 100$ if and only if $n + 10$ is a factor of $900$. 
That is $ (n+1) \cdot k = 900$ for some integer $k$.
If we take $ k = 1$, then $n + 10 = 900$ and $n = 890$.
So, the largest positive integer $n$ for which $n^3 + 100$ is divisible by $n + 10$ is $890$.
