    \textbf{Solution: }
    \par
    % long division of 12n+1 by 30n+2
    Here
    % gcd of 12n+1 and 30n+2 is 1
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        gcd(12n+1,30n+2) &= gcd(12n+1, (30n+2) mod (12n+1))\\
        & = gcd(12n+1, (30n+2) - 2(12n+1))\\
        & = gcd(12n+1, 6n)\\
        & = gcd(6n, (12n+1) mod 6n)\\
        & = gcd(6n, (12n+1) - 2(6n))\\
        & = gcd(6n, 1)\\
        \Rightarrow gcd(12n+1,30n+2) & = 1  \\
    \end{aligned}
    $$
So $12n+1$ and $30n+2$ are co-prime. Therefore the fraction $\frac{12n+1}{30n+2}$ is irreducible for all positive integers n.
