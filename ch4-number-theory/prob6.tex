\textbf{Solution: }
\par
Let, $ n! + 5 = k^3 $ \\
For $n\geq10$, 100\textbackslash n!.
So, $ n! + 5 \equiv 5 \pmod{100} $ \\
Therefore, $ k^3 \equiv 5 \pmod{100} $, which is not possible since $k^3$ wil have only one factor of 5.\\
\par
Therefore n is less than 10.\\
For $n = 1$, $n! + 5 = 6$ which is not a perfect cube.\\
For $n = 2$, $n! + 5 = 7$ which is not a perfect cube.\\
For $n = 3$, $n! + 5 = 11$ which is not a perfect cube.\\
For $n = 4$, $n! + 5 = 29$ which is not a perfect cube.\\
For $n = 5$, $n! + 5 = 125 = 5^3$ which is a perfect cube.\\
For $n = 6$, $n! + 5 = 725$ which is not a perfect cube.\\
For $n = 7$, $n! + 5 = 5045$ which is not a perfect cube.\\
For $n = 8$, $n! + 5 = 40325$ which is not a perfect cube.\\
For $n = 9$, $n! + 5 = 362885$ which is not a perfect cube.\\
\par
Therefore, the only positive integer n for which $n! + 5$ is a perfect cube is 5.
